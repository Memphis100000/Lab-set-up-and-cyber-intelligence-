Description of how I will set up my lab
Setting up my lab involves installation of various softwares and virtual machines. I installed the mvware application and in it I installed the Ubuntu virtual machine. From there I tried to install the kali linix sevaral times but all failed later causing problems to my machine which was later formated therefore loosing everything I've worked for so far.
